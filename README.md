Power BI Dashboard

![Report](https://github.com/Thejaa97/Performance-Report/assets/170193307/405d1d49-6f0e-4b21-8240-3c61b7ac6af2)

## Project Overview

This condensed dynamic performance dashboard utilises specially SWITCH measures and some conditional formatting to understand main pain points which is created based on madeup plant company. The report mainly focuses on Gross Profit, Quantity and Sales performances.

## Dataset Overview

Here I used three different Excel data tables which contains plant fact data, accounts data and plant hierarchy data based on 2022, 2023 and 2024.

## Steps I followed

1. Data cleaning and processing
2. Building virtual tables
3. Building measures and core visuals for the modelling
4. Formatting and conditional formatting
5. Main visuals: Treemap, Waterfall chart, Combo chart, Scatter chart with Zoom slider
6. Tidying up: Dynamic chart titles, Axis titles and formatting
7. Final Tweaks and Review

## Insights

## Top KPIs:

1. Year to Date (YTD)
2. Prior year to Date (PYTD)
3. YTD vs PYTD
4. Gross Profit percentage(GP%)

*  Canada, Colombia, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Czech Republic, Greece, Vietnam, South Korea and Kenya are the bottom 10 countries based on YTD vs PYTD. So top bottom countries like Canada, Colombia and Croatia are the countries we need to focusing on new strategies or rethink how we're approaching the markets. 
*  Gross profit major declines in March($96K) and April($90K) in 2024. Canada is contributing a majority to this declines YTD and majoring of it's coming from landscape products by YTD vs PYTD as $18K.
*  February is the best month for Gross profit for the first quarter in 2024 and Gross profit exceeds the same period of the last year by $0.11M.
*  By focusing on account profitability segmentation chart, we can build up more rapport to with the accounts get more sales in those profitability ranges 

## What I learned
- How to build SWITCH measures for dynamic analysis by saving space
- Building virtual tables that need to be made for the model
- How to build the model using DAX measures and calculated columns
- Designing main visuals using Waterfall and scatter charts
- The importance of creating a condensed dynamic dashboard visualization for better data-driven decision-making
